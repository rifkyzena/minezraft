# minezraft

MineZraft was my attempt to replicate Minecraft in three.js, or at least just the diorama of Steve, some trees, and a creeper sneaking behind him. The interactive elements of MineZraft involve a camera which can be dragged with your mouse to see over the scene, daylight and nighttime system which can be toggled by pressing the space bar.
